# Alpha Beta Pruning and Monte Carlo Search Tree Game

Welcome to the Alpha Beta Pruning and Monte Carlo Search Tree game project! This project allows you to explore and interact with two powerful AI techniques used in game playing.

# How to Run the Project:
To get started, open this project in your preferred development environment, such as Visual Studio Code or Eclipse.

# Game Options:
Upon launching the program, you will be presented with three exciting options:

Play against an Alpha-Beta Agent: Challenge yourself against an AI agent that uses the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm for making strategic decisions.

Play against a MCST Agent: Test your skills against an AI agent that utilizes the Monte Carlo Search Tree algorithm to make its moves.

Play against Both Agents: Enjoy a dynamic gaming experience where both Alpha-Beta and MCST agents take turns randomly during the game.
